While reading through the different books and implementing different containers/algorithms there will be information you need flash cards on.

Approach: Read a chapter of a book first or look at videos, then later reread or skim it and pull out the important info into flash cards. 
Reguraly look at these flash cards.

Note: this notepad notes of *some* of the stuff you still have to make cards on. Some of this may be repeated.

write great code volume 1: understanding the machine:
	chapter 2:
		low/high order vs least/most significant bit/byte/word
		word?
		how to get 2's complement and what it is used for
		range of numbers for n bits in which you must represent signed numbers vs without
		0-15 in binary <-> hex
		powers of 2 from 0 to 32
		sign/Zero extension and contraction (converting between 16 bit and 8 bit numbers), saturation and why
			(With the twoâ€™s complement system, a single negative value will have
			different representations depending on size of the representation)
		BCD
		fixed-point representation and floating-point representation.
		Scaled Numeric Formats, Rational Representation
	chapter 3: BINARY ARITHMETIC AND BIT OPERATIONS
