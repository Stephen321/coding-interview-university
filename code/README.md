## Practice C++

*Move to a seperate repos...*

#### Layout  
- *coding-interview-university* contains seperate folders per data structure, algorithm, etc from the github page  *(only headers and src files)*  
- *books* contains folder seperated code for any implementations/testing from the book list
- *sfmldemo* is for an overall visual demo of everything demoable. *(move to a seperate repos?)*  

#### Testing  
- Debug and profiling: http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html   
- Unit testing: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2
